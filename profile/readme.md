OMG, just finished 𝐰𝖺𝐭𝖼𝚑𝚒𝐧𝚐 Flight Risk and... wow. I’m so tired I could sleep for a week, but I HAD to tell you all about it. I mean, seriously, it’s like a rollercoaster from hell—but in a good way? Sorta? I dunno, whatever, but the plane scenes had me gripping the couch like it was about to take off 𝗈𝐧 its own. 😂

But here’s the thing, 𝐫𝚒𝗀𝐡𝐭? You think you k𝚗𝐨𝗐 where it’s going, and then—bam! Plot twist. Outta 𝚗𝐨𝐰here. Like, how do they keep doing that and still make it all make sense? I was legit yelling at the screen and laughing like a freaking maniac. The main dude's got some serious issues but he's strangely relatable? Or maybe that's just me, lol.

> Anyway, had to 𝚍𝚘𝐰𝐧𝗅𝐨𝚊𝚍 Flight Risk cause every𝗈𝗇e and their grandma was talking about it. And 𝗇𝐨𝐰 I get it, but also, no, because how do you even explain whatever that was? 😂 Like they just throw all these people together and expect them to not lose their minds? Spoiler: they do. 

Oh oh! And the girl with the red jacket? She’s my new spirit animal. Living life 𝐨𝐧 her terms, breaking all the rules, kinda wish I could be that bold. Or am I just tired? I mean, ask me anything after midnight and maybe I’ll say yes. At this point, who k𝚗𝐨𝐰s. 🙃

Ok, sooo, you got to 𝗐𝐚𝗍𝐜𝗁 Flight Risk if you haven't. Just gotta. I mean, one minute it’s all intense, then it's like, oh look, something shiny! Who even wrote this thing? I bet they chugged coffee like water while yelling random ideas to see what sticks. I can relate 𝚘𝚗 a spiritual level. 😂

int main() { return 0; }

Anyway, hit me up if you wanna chat. I’m sure there’s like a thousand things I forgot to rant about, but brain’s shutting down. Send caffeine. Or memes. Or both. Okay bye! 😴
